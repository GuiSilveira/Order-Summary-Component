## My process

I started by the HTML trying to think as much as possible in how the box model works. Then i started by setting the containers to every part like the image and the payment infos. After that i applied all the hover effects and it's done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about how to display the itens on the screen correctly. I could practice my Flexbox skills and see it improving while i was finishing the project. Also, i could start to think and practice the Mobile-first concept.

### Continued development
